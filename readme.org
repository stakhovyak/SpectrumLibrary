* Laplacian matrices for spectral graph theory related tasks

** Why this exists?

Solely for my artisic needs and creative programming tasks.

** Why use it?

Because you don't only calculate laplacian matrices with the lib, but
you can tie up your functions to certain events, happening inside the
graphs represented by sparse matrices during transformations or user-defined
algorithms evaluation.

** TODOs

*** DONE [#A] getCol() getRow() do not pass the tests!
*** DONE [#A] Implement CRS sparse matrix representation
*** TODO [#A] Test CSR methods and document it with examples 
*** TODO [#A] Implement subscriber/publisher logic in matrices
*** TODO [#B] functional primitives spApp, spRef, spMV, spGEMM etc...
*** TODO [#B] special hooks api for the matrices
